About the range of rotation gain:

    "This suggests that rotation gain—within the range
    of [0.85;1.18] as tested in the experiment—can be used in a CAVE
    environment in practice without causing physical discomfort, dimin-
    ishing the realism of the experience, or inducing additional cognitive
    load."

Also mentioned here:

    Interestingly, the estimated threshold values vary significantly from
    one study to another. For rotation gain, Jerald et. al [Jerald et al. 2008] 
    estimated detection thresholds at 11.2% for positive (same di-
    rection as real world rotation) gain and at 5.2% for negative (going
    opposite to real world rotation) gain.
    ...
    This study yielded a very different set of threshold estimates for
    both rotation (41% and 10% respectively)

Found a paper doing a similar thing as we are 
(http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.111.613&rep=rep1&type=pdf) 
but they give specific instructions to users to watch the discrations.


    We successfully implemented and tested a ROT using distractors to
    minimize the observed rotation of a VE during reorientation. ROTs
    using distractors were preferred and ranked more natural by users
    than current ROTs without distractors. We also found subjects were
    less aware of turning around in the VE when reorienting using a
    distractor
